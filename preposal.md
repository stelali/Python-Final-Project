# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to try to screenscrape Reddit Am I the A-Hole? pages. One of the Harvard python students completed a similar project but general to all subredddits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4AwYFeyYGo. I would like to focus on AITA and see the verdict of the questions. There are four verdicts: YTA (you're the a-hole), NTA (not the a-hole), ESH (everyone sucks here), and NAH (no a-holes here).

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am planning on collaborating with Ernest Wong.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I was wondering what the best way to start the project would be. Do you have any resources you recommend checking out?
