# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Reddit AITA Analyzer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Use praw for Reddit Screenscrape. Sentiment analyze package to look through words. Create some type of portal to look at it.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will look like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4AwYFeyYGo, except focusing on one single post and analyzing the comments from the post. Instead of looking up a subreddit, it will be a lookup of a single post.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A, not combining

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Ernest Wong 
Email - ernest.wong@temple.edu
TA - not sure

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Using praw to screenscrape Reddit. I have already started and gotten to the point where it can look at the titles of the posts and export to a csv.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I can definitely accomplish the screenscraping and sentiment analysis. I am not sure about making a site.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I accomplish all three.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next step will be working with PRAW to focus on comments and download them into CSV. I settled on using FLAIR for sentiment analysis, so I need to read into how to use it. I need to set up meetings with Ernest in order to check in on project progress, maybe one time a week.
